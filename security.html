        <h3>Key Areas of Focus and Action Plan for the Next Year</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="slide">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong>This presentation highlights areas to improve in security practices, system management, and employee training, along with securing necessary budget for key security tools and services.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="slide">
        <h2>Current System Overview</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="problem">Employee Onboarding & Offboarding: Lack of coordination when an employee joins or leaves, leading to missed opportunities to configure systems properly or remove access.</li>
            <li class="problem">Security Weaknesses: Weak password practices, lack of 2FA, and inconsistent use of password managers. Employees may not notify IT when passwords are changed or when new sites are registered using company accounts.</li>
            <li class="problem">Backup Procedures: No clear, enforced process for backing up systems on a regular basis.</li>
            <li class="problem">Training Gaps: Employees may not fully understand secure password practices, backup procedures, or how to leverage AI tools for increased productivity and security.</li>
            <li class="problem">Funding for Security: Limited budget for purchasing the necessary products and services to keep systems and accounts secure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What I Would Like to Improve in the System</h2>
        <h3>Key Areas for Improvement</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Employee Onboarding & Offboarding</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li class="problem">Problem: Not aware when employees are joining or leaving, making it hard to configure systems and manage access properly.</li>
                    <li class="goal">Goal: Automate and standardize onboarding/offboarding processes to ensure system readiness and secure account management.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Strengthening Security Practices</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li class="problem">Problem: Weak password usage, lack of 2FA, and no clear process for managing passwords and site registrations.</li>
                    <li class="goal">Goal: Enforce strong passwords, mandate password managers (e.g., LastPass, 1Password), require 2FA, and ensure company accounts are used for work-related activities only.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Regular System Backups</strong>
